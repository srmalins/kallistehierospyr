## Who is Kalliste Hieros Pyr?

*Kalliste Hieros Pyr* is a collection of Hekatean Witches that are dedicated to the core values below. Initially formed from Mystai students of the 2022-23 cohort, but may grow to include others with the consensus of the group once formed. 

Acceptance of the invitation implies agreement to the core values below and consent to abide by their implications as delineated below. Violations of the core values will be addressed by the group and consequences may include removal from the group. 

**While the initial group is formed from Mystai students, this group is independent and participation is neither necessary nor sufficient for any coursework in Covina or any other institution.**

## Core Values 

Discussion of any topics not in conflict with the Core Values below is permitted. 

## Sovereignty

We affirm that sovereignty is an inalienable right of all individuals; this includes sovereignty over ones narrative. In keeping with this value 

- We respect the sovereignty of gender of all individuals; 
- We refuse to reveal personal information revealed in the group outside of the group; 
- Hate speech is absolutely prohibited and there is a zero tolerance for blatant examples. 

## Integrity 

We strive always to act with integrity. In keeping with this value:

- We do not engage in fraud, subterfuge, or tolerate intentional misrepresentations of fact; 
- We strive to keep our promises and avoid unwise or unclear commitments. 

## Friendship 

The primary goal of *Kalliste Hieros Pyr* is to deepen the bonds of friendship between members. We consider every member a friend, and as such: 

- We support each other and demonstrate through our words that we want only the best for each other; 
- We do our best to make each member feel safe and welcome; 
- We support each other in good times and bad times; 
- We share our passions, hobbies, interests, and obsessions with each other freely and accept others sharing.
