*Kalliste Hieros Pyr* is a combination of epithets for the Goddess Hekate that means *"Fairest Holy Fire"* We are a group of Hekatean Witches that are also friends. Primarily we communicate through a group chat on the secure communications network Signal. The group started with Mystai students of the Covina Institute, founded by Dr. Cyndi Brannen; it may or may not expand to include other Hekatean Witches with similar values. Any expansion will be by consensus of the extant and active membership. 

## What we are here for

- Friendship and encouragement in all aspects of our life that we choose to share with the group
- TV shows, pop culture, music, and other fun hobbies that directly or tangentially intersect with our Witchcraft
- Witchcraft! Projects, spells, books, thoughts, philosophical discussions, and witchy nonsense!

## What we are not here for 

- To replace any coursework or group within or outside Covina; 
- To talk behind people's back or otherwise act without integrity see [Core Values]( {{< ref "posts/values" >}})
