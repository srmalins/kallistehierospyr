## Group Chat

*Kalliste Hieros Pyr* will initially be a collaborative group chat using Signal. At some point we may collectively decide to use other methods of communication. We may also collectively decide on public or semi public projects that advance our [Core Values]( {{< ref "posts/values" >}}). 

## Invitation 

Membership is by invitation only. After the initial group formation, invitation will be by consensus of the active membership. 

*Participation is completely voluntary. Kalliste Hieros Pyr is independent of and not a requirement for any other course or program of study* 

## Core Values

Acceptance of the invitation and joining the signal group implies consent to the [Core Values]( {{< ref "posts/values" >}}) and a commitment to uphold them.
