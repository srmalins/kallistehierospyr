      <description>Kalliste Hieros Pyr is a combination of epithets for the Goddess Hekate that means &amp;ldquo;Fairest Holy Fire&amp;rdquo; We are a group of Hekatean Witches that are also friends. Primarily we communicate through a group chat on the secure communications network Signal. The group started with Mystai students of the Covina Institute, founded by Dr. Cyndi Brannen; it may or may not expand to include other Hekatean Witches with similar values. Any expansion will be by consensus of the extant and active membership.</description>
